Iris Dataset Analysis and Visualization. 

Project Overview 

The project aims to analyze the iris dataset and use python libraries and programs to explore, clean, analyze, and create visualizations. The main objective is to use the GitHub respiratory to collaborate as a team and analyze the dataset. 

Problem Statement 

Programmers usually collect data from various sources, this data has to be cleaned and stored in a CSV file before using Python programs and libraries to analyze and visualize it. The challenge is to use python programs and libraries to clean, analyze, and visualize the dataset. 

Methodology 

GitHub setup: Created a GitHub repository and added a notebook 

Data cleaning: Converted the Iris dataset from a word document to a CSV file using excel. Added the species' column name and identified missing values. 

Data analysis: Used loops, if statements, def functions, and panda libraries to find mean, min, max, correlation, and median values for numerical columns. 

Visualizations: Plotted bar chart, histogram, scatter plot, and box plot to find the relationship between sepal and petal dimensions. 

Tools and Technologies 

Programming language: Python 

Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib 

Visualization: Bar chart, histogram, scatter plot, and box plot 

Repository: GitHub and Colab notebook 

Results 

Determined correlation between the petal dimensions. 

Created a summary text file to provide more information on mean, max, min, and median values about our code to other users. 

Use the boxplot to find interquartile range, outliners, and range. 

Visualization Examples 

1.Histogram and barchart 

2.Boxplot and Scatterplot
